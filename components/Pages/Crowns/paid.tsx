          Progress isn&apos;t just tracked. It&apos;s honored.

          Crown Achievements mark your defining moments — the milestones where discipline, intention, and mastery align. Every crown earned represents a personal victory: syncing daily, hitting PRs, mastering your meals, or staying consistent through resistance.

          This isn&apos;t about flashy badges or empty rewards. Crowns are earned through real effort, and each one reflects your evolving commitment to your form — physical, mental, and energetic.

          Crown types include:
          Sync Streaks — for showing up daily, even when it&apos;s hard.

          Strength Milestones — PRs, total rep records, volume surges.

          Nutrient Mastery — logging complete meals with accurate macros & micros.

          Consistency Crowns — staying within your calorie zone for a full week.

          Recovery Honors — logging rest days, managing soreness, and staying aligned.

          Crowns are visible proof that you&apos;re not just going through the motions — you&apos;re building your form, one intentional day at a time.

          Earn them. Reflect on them. Let them remind you who you are becoming. </p>
